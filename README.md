# On the Origin of Digital Species

This repository contains the intelligent agent for the Atari game Breakout, presented at Tedx IST Alamdeda 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal. In my talk, I explained the analogy between natural evolution and simulated evolution. I illustrated, how humanity has bred wolves into dogs and how we can use the same principles in computer science to develop artificial intelligence that excels at playing video games from the 1970s.

From a technical perspective, the simulation was taken from the OpenAI Gym. The algorithm used is Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies, which evolves topologies and weights for artificial neural networks.
